# GeneticAlgorithm

Ready to use Genetic Algorithm

Steps:
1. Define variables in main.ipynb with name (for you to reference them later on) and the allowed value range they can have. Note that these values can be int, float, string etc
2. Add the fitness function in calculateFitness of class Individual in GA.py. This function must set self.fitness as single digit number where higher is better
3. Run main.ipynb to find the optimal parameter setting
